# Chatbot

a web-based chatbot using Flask and deep learning techniques. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of categories (intents), pattern and responses, and can respond to a wide range of user queries.

The chatbot is trained using a deep learning model. The model is a special artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained  to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses. The model is trained using the Keras library.

The chatbot is implemented as a web-based application using Flask, which makes it easy to deploy and use.
## How to use:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app with `python app.py`
4. Open a web browser and navigate to the chatbot's URL.
5. Type in your query and press Enter.
6. The chatbot will respond to your query.
